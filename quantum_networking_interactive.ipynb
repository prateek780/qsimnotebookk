    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fascinating world of **Quantum Networking**! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive notebook, you'll learn the fundamentals of quantum communication protocols and get hands-on experience with quantum key distribution, entanglement, and quantum network simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Quantum Networking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum networking leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to create ultra-secure communication channels. Unlike classical networks that transmit bits (0s and 1s), quantum networks transmit quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in superposition states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: Secure key sharing using quantum mechanics\n",
    "- **Quantum Entanglement**: Spooky action at a distance for instant correlation\n",
    "- **BB84 Protocol**: A pioneering quantum cryptography protocol\n",
    "- **Quantum Channels**: The medium for transmitting qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand quantum networking fundamentals\n",
    "2. Implement quantum protocols from scratch\n",
    "3. Interact with a live quantum network simulation\n",
    "4. Write your own quantum host implementations\n",
    "5. Analyze quantum security and error rates\n",

    "1. **Look for `pass` statements** in the code\n",
    "2. **Read the hints** (exact code provided)\n",

    "4. **Run and test** immediately!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ** Why This Works So Well:**\n",
    "- ** Minimal Code**: Only 1-4 lines per method\n",
    "- ** Exact Hints**: No guessing - hints show exact syntax\n",
    "- ** Progressive**: Gets easier (4‚Üí3‚Üí2‚Üí1 lines)\n",
    "- ** Instant Testing**: See results right away\n",

    "##  STUDENT CODE ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **What Has Been Implemented:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ** NO HARDCODED FALLBACKS**: All BB84 methods completely block execution without student implementations\n",
    "2. ** MANDATORY STUDENT CODE**: `require_student_code=True` is forced and cannot be disabled\n",
    "3. ** METHOD-LEVEL BLOCKING**: Each BB84 operation individually requires student implementation:\n",
    "   - `bb84_send_qubits()` - BLOCKED without student code\n",
    "   - `process_received_qbit()` - BLOCKED without student code  \n",
    "   - `bb84_reconcile_bases()` - BLOCKED without student code\n",
    "   - `bb84_estimate_error_rate()` - BLOCKED without student code\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ** CLEAR ERROR MESSAGES**: Students get explicit feedback about what they need to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **How Student Code Enforcement Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Without Student Implementation**: All quantum operations return `False` and show blocking messages\n",
    "- **With Student Implementation**: Validation checks ensure all required methods are present\n",
    "- **No Bypass Options**: The `require_student_code` parameter is always `True`\n",
    "- **Method Validation**: Each BB84 method checks for student implementation before proceeding\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Verification Test Above Confirms:**\n",
    "-  All BB84 operations are blocked without student code\n",
    "-  No hardcoded algorithms can execute\n",
    "-  Students absolutely must implement BB84 to proceed\n",
    "-  The simulation is 100% student-code-dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **For Students to Use the Simulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement StudentQuantumHost** with all required BB84 methods\n",
    "2. **Create StudentImplementation bridge** to connect with simulation\n",
    "3. **Pass implementation** to InteractiveQuantumHost constructor\n",
