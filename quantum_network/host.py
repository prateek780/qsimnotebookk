Educational Quantum Host Module
==============================

This module now uses the InteractiveQuantumHost for educational purposes.
Students can implement their own quantum networking protocols by creating
custom implementations and passing them to the InteractiveQuantumHost.

The original hardcoded implementation has been preserved in host_original.py
