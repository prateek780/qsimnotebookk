## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Open the Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook quantum_networking_interactive.ipynb
```

### Step 2: Work Through Sections
1. **Section 1**: Learn quantum fundamentals
2. **Section 2**: Explore the simulation interface
3. **Section 3**: Implement BB84 algorithms (the main challenge!)
4. **Export & Run**: Connect your code to the simulation

### Step 3: Implement BB84
In Section 3, you'll implement these methods:

```python
class StudentImplementationBridge:
    def bb84_send_qubits(self, num_qubits):
        # Send qubits using BB84 protocol
        pass
    
    def process_received_qbit(self, qbit, from_channel):
        # Receive and measure qubits
        pass
    
    def bb84_reconcile_bases(self, their_bases):
        # Compare bases and find shared indices
        pass
    
    def bb84_estimate_error_rate(self, their_bits_sample):
        # Estimate error rate for eavesdropper detection
        pass
```

### Step 4: Export Implementation
Run the export cell in the notebook:
```python
# This creates student_implementation_status.json
# and connects your code to the simulation
```

### Step 5: Run Complete Simulation
Either run from the notebook or command line:
```bash
python complete_simulation.py
```

## 🎮 What Happens in the Simulation

### 1. World Creation 🌍
- Creates classical and quantum network zones
- Sets up network infrastructure

### 2. Network Setup 🔌
- Classical hosts (Alice, Bob) with routers
- Quantum hosts using **YOUR BB84 implementation**
- Quantum channels for qubit transmission

### 3. BB84 Protocol ⚛️
- Alice sends qubits using your `bb84_send_qubits()`
- Bob receives and measures using your `process_received_qbit()`
- Basis reconciliation with your `bb84_reconcile_bases()`
- Error estimation with your `bb84_estimate_error_rate()`

### 4. Key Establishment 🔑
- Both parties derive shared secret key
- Key verification and integrity checks

### 5. Secure Communication 🔐
- XOR encryption using quantum key
- One-time pad encryption (perfect security!)
- Message transmission and decryption

### 6. Results & Analysis 📊
- Comprehensive simulation report
- Success rates and error analysis
- Learning statistics

## 🛠️ Implementation Requirements

Your BB84 implementation must handle:

### Qubit Generation
```python
def bb84_send_qubits(self, num_qubits):
    """
    Generate and send qubits for BB84.
    
    For each qubit:
    1. Choose random bit (0 or 1)
    2. Choose random basis ('Z' or 'X')
    3. Prepare qubit in chosen basis
    4. Send through quantum channel
    """
```

### Qubit Measurement
```python
def process_received_qbit(self, qbit, from_channel):
    """
    Receive and measure qubits.
    
    For each received qubit:
    1. Choose random measurement basis
    2. Measure qubit in chosen basis
    3. Store basis choice and outcome
    """
```

### Basis Reconciliation
```python
def bb84_reconcile_bases(self, their_bases):
    """
    Compare measurement bases.
    
    1. Compare your bases with sender's bases
    2. Find indices where bases match
    3. These become the shared key indices
    """
```

### Error Estimation
```python
def bb84_estimate_error_rate(self, their_bits_sample):
    """
    Estimate channel error rate.
    
    1. Compare sample of your bits with sender's
    2. Calculate error rate
    3. If error rate too high, suspect eavesdropper
    """
```

## 📈 Success Criteria

Your implementation succeeds when:
- ✅ BB84 protocol completes without errors
- ✅ Alice and Bob establish matching keys
- ✅ Error rate is below threshold (< 15%)
- ✅ Messages encrypt/decrypt correctly
- ✅ Simulation report shows 100% success

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Common Issues:

**1. "Student implementation not ready"**
- Make sure you've implemented all 4 required methods
- Run the export cell in the notebook
- Check that `student_implementation_status.json` exists

**2. "Keys don't match"**
- Check basis reconciliation logic
- Ensure measurement outcomes are stored correctly
- Verify shared indices calculation

**3. "High error rate"**
- Check qubit preparation logic
- Verify measurement basis handling
- Ensure Z basis uses |0⟩, |1⟩ states
- Ensure X basis uses |+⟩, |-⟩ states

**4. "Import errors"**
- Install required packages: `pip install qutip numpy`
- Run from project root directory
- Check Python path includes current directory

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Test integration
python test_integration.py

# Check implementation status
python -c "from quantum_network.notebook_bridge import check_simulation_readiness; print(check_simulation_readiness())"

# Run with verbose output
python complete_simulation.py --verbose
```
